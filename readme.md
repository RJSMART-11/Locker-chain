# Locker - Chain #

### Summary: ###

The project aims to create a smart contract that connects to a real-world lock system, allowing users to open and pay for a locker through the use of a QR code. The locker will be equipped with an inbuilt scale to weigh items placed inside, and users will be charged for a clothing wash accordingly. The smart contract will also allow users to specify a pickup time for their items and choose between different laundry service prices. The app will then send progress updates to the user throughout the laundry process.

The project will utilize the following technologies:

- Python for the backend development, including the development of the smart contract and integration with the lock system.
- Streamlit for the frontend development, including the development of the user-facing mobile application.
- Hardware integration for the inbuilt scale and lock system.
- Payment gateway integration for processing user payments.

The final product will provide a convenient and secure way for users to store and wash their clothing, with the added benefits of automated payment processing, flexible pickup times, and real-time progress updates
